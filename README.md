# Goal

The goal of this project is to replicate the design on this article [Gods Unchained Blog Post](https://blog.godsunchained.com/2021/04/07/immutable-x-marketplace-early-access/) for showing a listing of a GU card.

I have taken the design and included the ability of showing a notification,
working towards a pleasent user experience when buying items on the IMX
Marketplace.

## About

This is Andrew Starosciak, thank you for taking the time
and considering me for a position on the team at Immutable X. It means alot
for your team to check out this site as a demonstration of work.

The overview of this project consists of how I would approach a project in
Angular, by setting up a package library to abstract away reusability and
organize my styles in a distribution-ready npm package following the Angular
Package Format (APF).

Feel free to reach out with any feedback. This project isn't complete in
totality given the limited turn around time and scope.

## Project Details

- Click Buy to see a notification pop-up.
